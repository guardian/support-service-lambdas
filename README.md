# zuora-auto-cancel
Contains three Scala lambdas behind the same API gateway:

*autoCancel*: This Scala Lambda is used to cancel subscriptions and memberships with overdue invoices, based on an event trigger within Zuora.

The full workflow is currently:
Zuora Callout > AWS CloudFront > AWS API Gateway (Lambda Proxy Integration) > AWS Lambda

An additional CloudFront distribution is currently required because callouts do not support SNI, and the default CloudFront distribution (which gets set up in front of API Gateway) seems to require it.

*paymentFailure*:

*stripeCustomerSourceUpdated*: Stripe works with card networks so that when a customer's card details are updated, this fires an event and we can provide an endpoint for Stripe to call.
So, this Scala lambda updates a customer's payment method. 

# Running locally

AWS has been configured to use the handleRequest method as the entry point for this Lambda. However, uploading new Lambda code to test every change during development would be a laborious process.

All of the 'real work' is handled by cancellationAttemptForPayload, so to get fast feedback when developing simply call this method with a sample payload and execute `sbt run`.

Note: to make REST API calls to Zuora, you will need to set the following environment variables when running locally:

- ZuoraRestUrl - for testing purposes this is: https://rest.apisandbox.zuora.com/v1
- ZuoraUsername
- ZuoraPassword

Always use DEV or UAT credentials when running locally. (For Lambda execution, the PROD values are set as encrypted environment variables within AWS, using the KMS key defined in CloudFormation).

# Testing

- Run `sbt test` to execute the unit tests
- If you need to validate that API Gateway can trigger Lambda execution successfully, deploy your changes to CODE and use Postman (or equivalent) to hit the API Gateway url with a valid payload.
- For a full integration test, you can trigger the callout from our UAT Zuora environment.
