# cancellation-sf-cases-api
API Gateway fronted lambda function for creating (`POST`) and updating (`PATCH`) SalesForce 'Cases', called during cancellation flow(s) within 'manage-frontend'.

All endpoints require...

- `x-api-key` header (generated by the `CancellationSFCasesApiKey` in the CloudFormation)
- and either...
  - `x-identity-id` header which specifies the identityID of the user to request data for _(sent in the `manage-frontend` use-case)_
  
#### Handling Multiple Environments
See [handlers/README](../README.md#3rd-party-service-environments) for information on how this aspect works.
