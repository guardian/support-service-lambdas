    "password": <password>
}

```
Sample response:

}
```

The cloudformation in this project doesn't define an api gateway, instead the lambda is just exported to be included in the '/subs' endpoint of the [digital subscription authorisation](https://github.com/guardian/digital-subscription-authorisation/blob/main/cloudformation.yaml) api gateway
